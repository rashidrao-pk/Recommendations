I have known Mr. Muhamad Rashid since 2017 as a graduate student in 
Computer Science. I taught him three courses in graduate related to Digital 
Image Processing. He performed very well in these courses. As a graduate 
student, he is curious about different algorithms. We also had many 
interactive sessions for three semesters.
He also opted for his MS research/thesis under my supervision, and it took 
one year to complete this research/thesis. He started his research work in 
the third semester and formally enrolled it as a thesis in the last semester 
to complete it. His research is focused on “Object Detection and 
Classification Based on Feature Fusion and Deep Convolutional Neural 
Network”. During this research, he published the research article in the Q1 
journal under my supervision. Furthermore, he also assisted me in 
undergraduate teaching by grading class assignments, quizzes, and 
semester projects.
During his whole interaction with me, he proved himself a hard worker as 
well as a dedicated student. He has good working habits. He has excellent 
abilities to work in an integrated environment as well as individually. I can 
safely say that he has sound knowledge and has excellent capability to 
grasp new ideas and concepts. With these qualities, he is cooperative, 
polite, and punctual. He has good communication in both written and oral 
as well as his presentation skills are impressive. He is quite capable of 
pursuing research at the Ph.D. level. I highly recommend him for further 
study and research at your prestigious university

Mr. Muhammad Rashid approached me for writing a letter of recommendation 
for his admission for Ph.D program. I am pleased to write this letter in support of 
Mr. Rashid who has been one of my students at the Department of Computer 
Science, COMSATS University Islamabad, Wah Campus. 
During his stay at COMSATS, I found him one of the best students I dealt with. I 
have watched him growing and seen his talents and abilities not only in the 
classroom but outside its walls, when interacting with all types of people, as well. 
He is diligent, aggressive, and self-starter. He has a very inquisitive mind and does 
not wait to be told to investigate or analyze problems; he has the ability to 
recognize and initiate what needs to be done. Mr. Rashid possesses a strong 
capability to undertake rigorous coursework and leading edge research activities. 
Furthermore, he can actively engage in numerous challenging tasks concurrently
without compromising the work-quality.
One of his matchless talents is the ability to grasp technically strenuous material 
on his own and come up with genuine and striking ideas. Due to his creative mind 
and inherent hard working nature, Mr. Rashid is expected to achieve a genuine 
development in any research area he will be involved in.
I believe that Mr. Rashid would be an excellent addition to any research team. I 
hope you will also find Mr. Rashid’s attributes and potential attractive and I hope 
that you will favorably consider his application for the Ph.D degree in your 
University.
I wish him best of luck.
