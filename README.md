## 1. Dr. Muhammad Sharif
I have known Mr. Muhamad Rashid since 2017 as a graduate student in 
Computer Science. I taught him three courses in graduate related to Digital 
Image Processing. He performed very well in these courses. As a graduate 
student, he is curious about different algorithms. We also had many 
interactive sessions for three semesters.
He also opted for his MS research/thesis under my supervision, and it took 
one year to complete this research/thesis. He started his research work in 
the third semester and formally enrolled it as a thesis in the last semester 
to complete it. His research is focused on “Object Detection and 
Classification Based on Feature Fusion and Deep Convolutional Neural 
Network”. During this research, he published the research article in the Q1 
journal under my supervision. Furthermore, he also assisted me in 
undergraduate teaching by grading class assignments, quizzes, and 
semester projects.
During his whole interaction with me, he proved himself a hard worker as 
well as a dedicated student. He has good working habits. He has excellent 
abilities to work in an integrated environment as well as individually. I can 
safely say that he has sound knowledge and has excellent capability to 
grasp new ideas and concepts. With these qualities, he is cooperative, 
polite, and punctual. He has good communication in both written and oral 
as well as his presentation skills are impressive. He is quite capable of 
pursuing research at the Ph.D. level. I highly recommend him for further 
study and research at your prestigious university
